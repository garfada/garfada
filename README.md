Garfada was think to substitute the old paper-method for meal registration and help its user to manager its meal 
distribution, guarantying the identity from whom got, when got, and how many times, being fast to register, easy to use,
and a source of truth for who is using and who checks its register.

Never more have disputes about how many meals was distributed or what dishes was severed in day, save your time counting
or listing meals by business, eliminate loses of information about your meals and more!
